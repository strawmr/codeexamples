    <p>Empirican Group, Inc. ("<strong>Empirican</strong>&rdquo;) has developed for the benefit of the users of its website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trialscout.com">https://www.trialscout.com</a>&nbsp;(the "Site") this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to demonstrate our serious commitment to protecting the privacy of the information that we collect through the Site. This Privacy Policy summarizes how Empirican handles the information that you voluntarily provide when you use the Site and that We may automatically collect when you visit the Site ("Personal Information").</p>
    <p>If you are accessing, using or browsing this Site on behalf of an individual other than yourself, which may be either a natural person or an entity other than yourself you represent that you are authorized to engage in the activities that you conduct within the Site on behalf of that person or entity.</p>
    <p>This Site is controlled and operated by Empirican from its offices within the United States. Accordingly, this Privacy Policy, and how Empirican handles the information that you voluntary provide when you use the Site and information that we may automatically collect when you visit the Site, is governed by United States federal and state laws, and not by the laws of any country, territory or jurisdiction other than the United States and its states. We make no representations that the Site is appropriate or available for use outside of the United States. Access to the Site from territories where its contents or purpose is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Site are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws and regulations.</p>
    <p>Your use of this Site will be deemed conclusively to constitute your acceptance of and agreement to this Privacy Policy and all portions hereof.</p>
    <p>Empirican reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change the Privacy Policy, we will then post the changes in appropriate places on the Site so that you are aware of the changed Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after the Effective Date for any such changes to the Privacy Policy will be deemed conclusively to constitute your acceptance of and agreement to the changed Privacy Policy; consequently, you should frequently review this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What Personal Information does Empirican collect?</strong></p>
    <p>You can access and browse the Site at any time without providing Personal Information that can be traced back to you.</p>
    <p>To use some of its services and access certain areas of the Site, you must provide Personal Information that can be traced back to you, such as full name, e-mail, and any clinical studies you are or have participated in. We collect this Personal Information that you voluntarily provide through the use of on-line data entry, survey, and registration forms. Empirican gathers most of this Personal Information from you during the process of rating a research center on the Site. Empirican also occasionally asks you for Information at other times, including when you complete optional survey forms, fill out optional contact forms for additional information on particular products and services or use a particular service. Accordingly, you can determine to a large extent what Information you wish to submit on a voluntary basis to Empirican.</p>
    <p>When you visit the Site, Empirican may also automatically collect with Cookies, and similar technology Information about your use of the Site. This technology Information cannot be traced back to You.&nbsp;<strong>Cookies</strong>&nbsp;are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer's hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. Empirican also automatically collects the location of your computer on the Internet, known as your internet protocol address ("IP Address"), when you visit the Site.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Why does Empirican need Your Information?</strong></p>
    <p>Empirican regularly makes improvements to the Site to provide its many users with a more personalized, relevant and intelligent service. The collection of Personal Information greatly assists Empirican in this improvement process by identifying the interests and needs of the many users to this Site. Collection of Personal Information also assists Empirican by allowing it and its affiliates to advertise its products and/or services in a more efficient manner. Through the use of Cookies, information we automatically collect when you use our Site, and on-line data entry, survey, product purchase and registration forms, Empirican may monitor, in aggregate and individual form, Personal Information. Although our primary goal in collecting Personal Information is to deliver a customized and personalized service to the users of the Site, Empirican may also use personal Information to: (i) send users e-mail notification of new features or information available through the Site or that Empirican otherwise feels might be of interest to users of this Site; and (ii) allow Empirican and its third party advertisers and retailers, and their affiliates, offering goods or services that Empirican thinks might be of interest to users, to deliver relevant information and offers to users in any form. Empirican collects IP addresses to advertise to you in accordance with the foregoing, as well as for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and others.</p>

    <p><strong>What does Empirican do to keep Your Personal Information Secure?</strong></p>
    <p>On this Site and within Empirican, we seek to use appropriate administrative, technical and physical security measures to reasonably safeguard your Information under our control from unauthorized use, release or access.

The secure server encrypts all information that you input before it is sent to Empirican.</p>
    <p>Please be advised, however, that although Empirican has endeavored to create a secure and reliable Site for its users, the confidentiality and security of any communication or material transmitted to or from Empirican via this Site or e-mail cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure at any time. When disclosing any Information, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to the public, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. Accordingly, you should consider carefully if you want to submit information that you would not want disclosed to the public and should recognize that your use of the Internet and this Site is solely at your risk. You, alone, are ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy for all your Information. Empirican has no responsibility or liability to anyone for the security of any of your Information transmitted via the Internet.</p>

    <p>To the extent hyperlinks are utilized to access other, third party, websites, including links provided as automated search results, you should be aware that these third-party web sites are not controlled by Empirican and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy.

    <p>As described in the "Why does Empirican need your Information?" section above, the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information greatly assists Empirican in creating a more personalized, relevant and intelligent service for you. Without your Information, we could not deliver to you in the most beneficial way Empirican's content and services. As discussed above in the "What Personal Information does Empirican collect?" section, registration and provision of Information that can be traced back to you is voluntary. In other words, you must "opt-in" to our use and disclosure of your Information for the marketing and other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If you opt-in to our use or sharing of your Information, you can later change your mind and opt-out. You may immediately opt-out from all future use and disclosure of your Personal Information for the marketing and other purposes described this Privacy Policy by requesting the removal of your Personal Information from Empirican&rsquo;s database as described in the "Do You have the ability to access and correct your Personal Information?" section below.</p>
    <p>Please note that if you opt-out as described above, Empirican will not be able to remove our Information from the databases of our affiliates or unaffiliated third parties with whom we have already shared your Information as of the date of your opt-out request. Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related messages from us, Empirican may still send administrative messages to you. You cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages from Empirican.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Do You have the ability to access, change or remove Your Personal Information?</strong></p>
