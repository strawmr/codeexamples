        <li><strong> Disclaimers</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>If you choose to use the TrialScout Platform or Collective Content, you do so voluntarily and at your sole risk. The TrialScout Platform and Collective Content is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, without warranty of any kind, either express or implied.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>You agree that you have had whatever opportunity you deem necessary to investigate the TrialScout Services, laws, rules, or regulations and/or Subscriber Services you are receiving.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other statutory rights. However, the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</strong></p>
    <ol start="12">
        <li><strong> Liability</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Unless your Country of Residence is in the EU, you acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the TrialScout Platform and Collective Content, or any other interaction you have with other Subscribers whether online remains with you. Neither TrialScout nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the TrialScout Platform or Collective Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) from the use of or inability to use the TrialScout Platform or Collective Content, (iii) from any communications, interactions or meetings with other Subscribers or other persons with whom you communicate, interact or meet with as a result of your use of the TrialScout Platform, or (iv) from your publishing of Subscriber Content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not TrialScout has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. In no event will TrialScout&rsquo;s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the TrialScout Platform including, but not limited to, from your publishing of any Subscriber Content via the TrialScout Platform, or from the use of or inability to use the TrialScout Platform or Collective Content exceed the amounts you have paid or owe for Subscriber Services via the TrialScout Platform in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between TrialScout and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. </strong></p>
    <ol start="13">
        <li><strong> Indemnification</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>You agree to release, defend (at TrialScout&rsquo;s option), indemnify, and hold TrialScout and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including but not limited to, TrialScout, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your breach of these Terms or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the TrialScout Platform or any TrialScout Services, (iii) your interaction with any Subscriber, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, participation or use, and (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights.</p>
    <ol start="14">
        <li><strong> Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>14.1&nbsp;<em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and TrialScout mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the TrialScout Platform, or the Collective Content (collectively, &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) will be settled by binding arbitration (the &ldquo;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo;). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and TrialScout agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</strong></p>
    <p>14.2&nbsp;<em>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</em>. You and TrialScout each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</p>
    <p>14.3&nbsp;<em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the &ldquo;<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&ldquo;) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1&ndash;800&ndash;778&ndash;7879.</p>
    <p>14.4&nbsp;<em>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</em>. In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, TrialScout agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside; (b) in Erie County, New York; (c) in any other location to which you and TrialScout both agree; (d) via phone or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.</p>
    <p>14.5&nbsp;<em>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney&rsquo;s Fees and Costs</em>. You and TrialScout agree that TrialScout will be responsible for payment of the balance of any initial filing fee under the AAA Rules in excess of $200 for claims of $75,000 or less. You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, TrialScout agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA Rules, to recover attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
    <p>14.6&nbsp;<em>Arbitrator&rsquo;s Decision</em>. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim.</p>
    <p><strong>14.7&nbsp;<em>Jury Trial Waiver</em>. You and TrialScout acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>14.8&nbsp;<em>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</em>. You and TrialScout acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class Subscriber in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and TrialScout both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party&rsquo;s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.</strong></p>
    <p>14.9&nbsp;<em>Severability</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.8, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.</p>
    <p>14.10&nbsp;<em>Survival</em>. This Section 19 will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the TrialScout Platform or terminate your TrialScout Account.</p>
